# Automated Billing Configuration Template

The Automated Billing Configuration demographics template enables agencies to
map out details needed for successful billing from the Bed Board for specific
configuration types.

Use the Automated Billing Configuration demographics template for residential
and inpatient billing configuration. The template enables agencies to map out
details needed for successful billing from the Bed Board for the following
configuration types:

  * Bed Board
  * Medication Maintenance
  * Batch Billing

Details are patient and program specific and are saved to a data grid. You can
enter multiple mappings per patient or program. Prior to using the Automated
Billing Configuration demographic template, you must enroll the patient in a
program with at least one diagnosis.

The grid should only have one entry per program for the effective begin and
end date.
